## Mission of the project

The project must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and either be a novel approach for existing areas, address an unfulfilled need, or be code needed to deliver OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.

The mission of OpenSSF Scorecard is to automate analysis on the security posture of open source projects.

The current charter of the OpenSSF Scorecard project can be found [here](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/CHARTER.md).

## IP policy and licensing due diligence

When contributing an existing Project to the OpenSSF, the contribution must undergo license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF). This step is only needed for the initial donation and only applicable here, if the project intends to join the OpenSSF Incubation stage.

- "yes / no / not applicable. If yes, provide a link to the corresponding GitHub issue."

## Project References
