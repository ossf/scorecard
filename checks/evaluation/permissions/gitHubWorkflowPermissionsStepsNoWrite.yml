id: gitHubWorkflowPermissionsStepsNoWrite
short: Checks that GitHub workflows do not have steps with dangerous write permissions
motivation: >
  Even with permissions default set to read, some scopes having write permissions in their steps brings incurs a risk to the project.
  By giving write permission to the Actions you call in jobs, an external Action you call could abuse them. Depending on the permissions,
  this could let the external Action commit unreviewed code, remove pre-submit checks to introduce a bug.
  For more information about the scopes and the vulnerabilities involved, see https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions.

implementation: >
  The probe is implemented by checking whether the `permissions` keyword is given non-write permissions for the following
  scopes: `statuses`, `checks`, `security-events`, `deployments`, `contents`, `packages`, `actions`.
  Write permissions given to recognized packaging actions or commands are allowed and are considered an acceptable risk.
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
    - Verify which permissions are needed and consider whether you can reduce them.
