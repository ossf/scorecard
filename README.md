## Motivation

A short motivational video clip to inspire us: https://youtu.be/rDMMYT3vkTk "You passed! All D's ... and an A!"

## Goals

1. Automate analysis and trust decisions on the security posture of open source projects.

1. Use this data to proactively improve the security posture of the critical projects the world depends on.

## Public Data

If you're only interested in seeing the results over time, we run this program nightly and publish the results in
`json` format.

This data is available on Google Cloud Storage and can be downloaded via the
[`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install)
command-line tool.

```shell
$ gsutil ls gs://ossf-scorecards/
gs://ossf-scorecards/11-11-2020.json
...
```

The latest results are also always available at
`https://storage.googleapis.com/ossf-scorecards/latest.json`.

The list of projects that are checked each night is available in the
[`cron/projects.txt`](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/projects.txt)
file in this repository. If you would like us to track more, please feel free to
send a Pull Request with others.

## Usage

The program only requires one argument to run, the name of the repo:

```shell
$ go build
$ ./scorecard --repo=github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes

### Package manager support

scorecard has an option to provide `--npm` package name and it would fetch the corresponding GitHub code.

```
./scorecard --npm=angular

### Authentication

Before running Scorecard, you need to
[create a GitHub access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/about-apps#personal-access-tokens)
and set it in environment variable `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN`.
This helps to avoid the GitHub's
[api rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting)
with unauthenticated requests.

```shell
# For posix platforms, e.g. linux, mac:
export GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>

# For windows:
set GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your access token>
```

#### GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN

Multiple `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` can be provided separated by comma to be utilized in a round robin fashion.

As an alternative to personal access tokens, we also support GitHub App Installations
for higher rate-limit quotas.
If you have an installed GitHub App and key file, you can use these three environment
variables, following the commands shown above for your platform.

```
GITHUB_APP_KEY_PATH=<path to the key file on disk>
GITHUB_APP_INSTALLATION_ID=<installation id>
GITHUB_APP_ID=<app id>
```

These can be obtained from the GitHub [developer settings](https://github.com/settings/apps) page.

## Checks

The following checks are all run against the target project:

To see detailed information about each check and remediation steps,
check out the [checks documentation page](checks.md).

If you'd like to add a check, make sure it is something that meets the following criteria:

- automate-able
- objective
- actionable

and then create a new GitHub Issue.

## Results

Each check returns a **Pass / Fail** decision, as well as a confidence score between **0 and 10**.
A confidence of 0 should indicate the check was unable to achieve any real signal, and the result
should be ignored.
A confidence of 10 indicates the check is completely sure of the result.

Many of the checks are based on heuristics, contributions are welcome to improve the detection!

### Running specific checks

To use a particular check(s), add the `--checks` argument with a list of check
names.

For example, `--checks=CI-Tests,Code-Review`.

### Formatting Results

There are three formats currently: `default`, `json`, and `csv`. Others may be added in the future.

These may be specified with the `--format` flag.

## Requirements

- The scorecard must only be composed of automate-able, objective data. For example, a project having 10 contributors doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more secure than a project with say 50 contributors. But, having two maintainers might be preferable to only having one - the larger bus factor and ability to provide code reviews is objectively better.
- The scorecard criteria can be as specific as possible and not limited general recommendations. For example, for Go, we can recommend/require specific linters and analyzers to be run on the codebase.
- The scorecard can be populated for any open source project without any work or interaction from maintainers.
- Maintainers must be provided with a mechanism to correct any automated scorecard findings they feel were made in error, provide "hints" for anything we can't detect automatically, and even dispute the applicability of a given scorecard finding for that repository.
- Any criteria in the scorecard must be actionable. It should be possible, with help, for any project to "check all the boxes".
- Any solution to compile a scorecard should be usable by the greater open source community to monitor upstream security.

## Docker

- The Dockerfile in the root directory utilizes [experimental features](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/syntax.md) which is available in Docker v18.09 or later.

## Contributing

If you want to get involved or have ideas you'd like to chat about, we discuss this project in the [OSSF Best Practices Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers) meetings.
