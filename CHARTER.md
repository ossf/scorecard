***Adopted April 24, 2024***

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the OpenSSF Scorecard open source project, which has been established as OpenSSF Scorecard a Series of LF Projects, LLC (the “Project”). LF Projects, LLC (“LF Projects”) is a Delaware series limited liability company. All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Project (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms of this Charter.

## 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

- a. The mission of the Project is to automate analysis on the security posture of open source projects.

- b. The scope of the Project includes collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.

## 2. Steering Committee

- a. The Steering Committee (the “SC”) will be responsible for all oversight of the open source Project.

- b. The SC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the “CONTRIBUTING” file within the Project’s code repository. The SC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the SC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.

- c. SC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The SC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in the CONTRIBUTING file. Unless otherwise documented:

  - i. Contributors include anyone in the project community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the Project;

  - ii. Committers are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and

  - iii. A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.

- d. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter.

- e. The SC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any SC roles, as it sees fit.

- f. The SC may elect a SC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the SC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the SC. The SC Chair, or any other SC member so designated by the SC, will serve as the primary communication contact between the Project and OpenSSF, a directed fund of The Linux Foundation.

- g. Responsibilities: The SC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

  - i. coordinating the technical direction of the Project;

  - ii. approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope);

  - iii. organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects;

  - iv. creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements;

  - v. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;

  - vi. establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies;

  - vii. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the CONTRIBUTING file) and coordinating with the series manager of the Project (as provided for in the Series Agreement, the “Series Manager”) to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 7 of this Charter;

  - viii. discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the code base that affect multiple projects; and

  - ix. coordinating any marketing, events, or communications regarding the Project.

## 3. SC Voting

- a. While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any SC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the SC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

- b. Quorum for SC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the SC to be present. The SC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

- c. Except as provided in Section 7.c. and 8.a, decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of all voting members of the SC.

- d. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the SC, any voting member of the SC may refer the matter to the Series Manager for assistance in reaching a resolution.

## 4. Compliance with Policies

- a. This Charter is subject to the Series Agreement for the Project and the Operating Agreement of LF Projects.

- d. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the SC, regardless of competitive interests.

- e. The Project will operate in a transparent, open, collaborative, and ethical manner at all times.
