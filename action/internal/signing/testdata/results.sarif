If\n\nthe provided token does not have admin access, the check will query the branch\n\nsettings accessible to non-admins and provide results based only on these settings.\n\nEven so, we recommend using a non-admin token, which provides a thorough enough\n\nresult to meet most user needs. \n\n\n\nDifferent types of branch protection protect against different risks:\n\n\n\n  - Require code review: requires at least one reviewer, which greatly\n\n    reduces the risk that a compromised contributor can inject malicious code.\n\n    Review also increases the likelihood that an unintentional vulnerability in\n\n    a contribution will be detected and fixed before the change is accepted.\n\n\n\n  - Prevent force push: prevents use of the `--force` command on public\n\n    branches, which overwrites code irrevocably. This protection prevents the\n\n    rewriting of public history without external notice.\n\n\n\n  - Require [status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks):\n\n    ensures that all required CI tests are met before a change is accepted. \n\n\n\nAlthough requiring code review can greatly reduce the chance that\n\nunintentional or malicious code enters the \"main\" branch, it is not feasible for\n\nall projects, such as those that don't have many active participants. For more\n\ndiscussion, see [Code Reviews](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#code-reviews).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, in some cases these rules will need to be suspended. For example,\n\nif a past commit includes illegal content such as child pornography, it may be\n\nnecessary to use a force push to rewrite the history rather than simply hide the\n\ncommit. \n\n\n\nThis test has tiered scoring. Each tier must be fully satisfied to achieve points at the next tier. For example, if you fulfill the Tier 3 checks but do not fulfill all the Tier 2 checks, you will not receive any points for Tier 3.\n\n\n\nNote: If Scorecard is run without an administrative access token, the requirements that specify “For administrators” are ignored.\n\n\n\nTier 1 Requirements (3/10 points):\n\n  - Prevent force push\n\n  - Prevent branch deletion\n\n  - For administrators: Include administrator for review\n\n\n\nTier 2 Requirements (6/10 points):\n\n  - Required reviewers \u003e=1 ​\n\n  - For administrators: Strict status checks (require branches to be up-to-date before merging)\n\n\n\nTier 3 Requirements (8/10 points):\n\n  - Status checks defined\n\n\n\nTier 4 Requirements (9/10 points):\n\n  - Required reviewers \u003e= 2\n\n\n\nTier 5 Requirements (10/10 points):\n\n  - For administrators: Dismiss stale reviews\n\n"

Users will often directly use executables if they are\n\nincluded in the source repository, leading to many dangerous behaviors.\n\n\n\nProblems with generated executable (binary) artifacts:\n\n\n\n  - Binary artifacts cannot be reviewed, allowing possible obsolete or\n\n    maliciously subverted executables. Reviews generally review source code, not\n\n    executables, since it's difficult to audit executables to ensure that they\n\n    correspond to the source code. Over time the included executables might not\n\n    correspond to the source code. \n\n  - Generated executables allow the executable generation process to atrophy,\n\n    which can lead to an inability to create working executables. These problems\n\n    can be countered with verified reproducible builds, but it's easier to\n\n    implement verified reproducible builds when executables are not included in\n\n    the source repository (since the executable generation process is less\n\n    likely to have atrophied). \n\n\n\nAllowed by Scorecards:\n\n\n\n  - Files in the source repository that are simultaneously reviewable source\n\n    code and executables, since these are reviewable. (Some interpretive\n\n    systems, such as many operating system shells, don't have a mechanism for\n\n    storing generated executables that are different from the source file.) \n\n  - Source code in the source repository generated by other tools (e.g., by\n\n    bison, yacc, flex, and lex). There are potential downsides to generated\n\n    source code, but generated source code tends to be much easier to review and\n\n    thus presents a lower risk. Generated source code is also often difficult\n\n    for external tools to detect. \n\n  - Generated documentation in source repositories. Generated documentation is\n\n    intended for use by humans (not computers) who can evaluate the context.\n\n    Thus, generated documentation doesn't pose the same level of risk.  \n\n"

If it is a library, you generally don't want to pin dependencies of library users, and should not follow any remediation steps.\n\n- If your project is producing an application, declare all your dependencies with specific versions in your package format file (e.g. `package.json` for npm, `requirements.txt` for python). For C/C++, check in the code from a trusted source and add a `README` on the specific version used (and the archive SHA hashes).\n\n- If the package manager supports lock files (e.g. `package-lock.json` for npm), make sure to check these in the source code as well. These files maintain signatures for the entire dependency tree and saves from future exploitation in case the package is compromised.\n\n- For Dockerfiles, pin dependencies by hash. See [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/worker/Dockerfile) for example. \n\n- For GitHub workflows, pin dependencies by hash. See [main.yaml](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/f55b86d6627cc3717e3a0395e03305e81b9a09be/.github/workflows/main.yml#L27) for example. To determine the permissions needed for your workflows, you may use [StepSecurity's online tool](https://app.stepsecurity.io/) by ticking the \"Pin actions to a full length commit SHA\". You may also tick the \"Restrict permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN\" to fix issues found by the Token-Permissions check.\n\n- To help update your dependencies after pinning them, use tools such as\n\n Github's [dependabot](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/)\n\nor [renovate bot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate).\n\n\n\n**Severity**: Medium\n\n\n\n**Details**:\n\nRisk: `Medium` (possible compromised dependencies)\n\n\n\nThis check tries to determine if the project pins its dependencies. \n\nA \"pinned dependency\" is a dependency that is explicitly set to a specific hash instead of \n\nallowing a mutable version or range of versions. It\n\nis currently limited to repositories hosted on GitHub, and does not support\n\nother source hosting repositories (i.e., Forges). \n\n\n\nThe check works by looking for unpinned dependencies in Dockerfiles, shell scripts and GitHub workflows.\n\n\n\nPinned dependencies reduce several security risks:\n\n\n\n  - They ensure that checking and deployment are all done with the same\n\n    software, reducing deployment risks, simplifying debugging, and enabling\n\n    reproducibility. \n\n  - They can help mitigate compromised dependencies from undermining the\n\n    security of the project (in the case where you've evaluated the pinned\n\n    dependency, you are confident it's not compromised, and a later version is\n\n    released that is compromised). \n\n  - They are one way to [counter dependency confusion (aka substitution) attacks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/),\n\n    in which an application uses multiple feeds to acquire software packages (a\n\n    \"hybrid configuration\"), and attackers fool the user into using a malicious\n\n    package via a feed that was not expected for that package.\n\n\n\nHowever, pinning dependencies can inhibit software updates, either because of a\n\nsecurity vulnerability or because the pinned version is compromised. Mitigate\n\nthis risk by:\n\n\n\n  - [having applications and _not_ libraries pin to specific hashes](https://jbeckwith.com/2019/12/18/package-lock/);\n\n  - using automated tools to notify applications when their dependencies are\n\n    outdated;\n\n  - quickly updating applications that do pin dependencies.\n\n\n\nFor projects hosted on GitHub, you can learn more about\n\ndependencies using the [GitHub dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph).\n\n"

Ideally at least some of these people will be from different organizations (see [Contributors](checks.md#contributors)). If the project has very limited utility, consider expanding its intended utility so more people will be interested in improving it, and make that larger scope clear to potential contributors.\n\n- Follow security best practices by performing strict code reviews for every new pull request / merge request.\n\n- Make \"code reviews\" mandatory in your repository configuration.

Reviews may also detect or deter an attacker trying to insert\n\nmalicious code (either as a malicious contributor or as an attacker who has\n\nsubverted a contributor's account), because a reviewer might detect the\n\nsubversion.\n\n\n\nThe check first tries to detect whether [Branch-Protection](checks.md#branch-protection) is enabled on the\n\ndefault branch with at least one required reviewer. If this fails, the check\n\ndetermines whether the most recent (~30) commits have a Github-approved review\n\nor if the merger is different from the committer (implicit review). It also\n\nperforms a similar check for reviews using\n\n[Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow#readme) (labels\n\n\"lgtm\" or \"approved\") and [Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/) (\"Reviewed-on\" and \"Reviewed-by\").\n\n\n\nNote: Requiring reviews for all changes is infeasible for some projects, such as\n\nthose with only one active participant. Even a project with multiple active\n\ncontributors may not have enough active participation to be able to require\n\nreview of all proposed changes. Projects with a small number of active\n\nparticipants instead sometimes aim for a review of a\n\npercentage of proposals (e.g., \"at least half of all proposed changes are\n\nreviewed\").\n\n\n\nRequiring review does not eliminate all risks. The other reviewers might fail to\n\nnotice unintentional vulnerabilities or malicious code, be colluding with a\n\nmalicious developer, or even be the same person (using a \"[sock\n\npuppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account)\" account).  \n\n"
