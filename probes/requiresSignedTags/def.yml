id: requiresSignedTags
lifecycle: stable
short: Check that signed tags are required
motivation: >
  Requiring signed tags ensures release tags are cryptographically verified and authenticated.
implementation: >
  Checks if RequireSignedCommits is enabled for protected release tags.
outcome:
  - If signed tags are required, the probe returns OutcomeTrue.
  - If unsigned tags are allowed, the probe returns OutcomeFalse.
  - If the tag is not protected, the probe returns OutcomeFalse.
  - If there are no release tags, the probe returns OutcomeNotApplicable.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Configure tag protection to require signed tags.
  markdown:
    - For GitHub enable require signed commits in repository rulesets.
    - For GitLab enforce through CI/CD policies.
    - Set up GPG or SSH signing keys for authorized creators.
