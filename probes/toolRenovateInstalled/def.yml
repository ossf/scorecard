id: toolRenovateInstalled
short: Check that Renovate bot is installed.
motivation: >
  Out-of-date dependencies make a project vulnerable to known flaws and prone to attacks.
  Renovate automates the process of updating dependencies by scanning for outdated or insecure requirements, and opening a pull request to update them if found.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for the presence of files named ".github/renovate.json", ".github/renovate.json5", ".renovaterc.json" or. "renovate.json".
  If none of these files are found, Renovate is not installed.
  NOTE: the implementation does not ensure that Renovate is run or that Renovate's pull requests are merged.
outcome:
  - If Renovate is installed, the probe returns OutcomePositive (1) for each configuration.
  - If Renovate is not installed, the probe returns OutcomeNegative (0).
remediation:
  effort: Low
