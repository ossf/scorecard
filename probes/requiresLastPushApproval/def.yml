id: requiresLastPushApproval
short: Check that the project requires approval of the most recent push.
motivation: >
  Requiring approval of the most recent push prevents contributors from sneaking malicious commits into a PR after it has been approved.
implementation: >
  The probe checks the protection rules of default and release branches branches.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomeTrue for each branch that requires approval of the most recent push, and one OutcomeFalse for branches that don't.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: High
  text:
    - Configure the project such that it requires approval of the most recent push.
    - For GitHub-hosted projects, see [the documentation on protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) and how to require approval of the last push from someone who did not make the last push.
    - For GitLab-hosted projects, see how to [remove all approvals when commits a added to the source branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.html#remove-all-approvals-when-commits-are-added-to-the-source-branch).
