id: hasDangerousWorkflowScriptInjection
short: Check whether the project has GitHub Actions workflows that enable script injection.
motivation: >
  Script injections allow attackers to use untrusted input to access privileged resources (code execution, secret exfiltration, etc.)
implementation: >
  The probe analyzes the repository's workflows for known dangerous patterns.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one finding with OutcomeTrue for each dangerous script injection pattern detected.
  - If no dangerous patterns are found, the probe returns one finding with OutcomeFalse.
remediation:
  onOutcome: True
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Avoid the dangerous workflow patterns.
  markdown:
    - Avoid the dangerous workflow patterns.
    - See [this document](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#understanding-the-risk-of-script-injections) for information on avoiding and mitigating the risk of script injections.
