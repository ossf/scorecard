id: hasDangerousWorkflowScriptInjection
short: Check whether the project has Github Actions workflows that enable script injection.
motivation: >
  Script Injection with Untrusted Context Variables: This pattern detects whether a workflow's inline script may execute untrusted input from attackers. This occurs when an attacker adds malicious commands and scripts to a context. When a workflow runs, these strings may be interpreted as code that is executed on the runner. Attackers can add their own content to certain github context variables that are considered untrusted, for example, github.event.issue.title. These values should not flow directly into executable code.
implementation: >
  The probe iterates through the workflows from the raw results and checks the workflow type. If it finds a workflow of the type `DangerousWorkflowScriptInjection`, it returns.
outcome:
  - If the project has at least one workflow with possibility of script injection, the probe returns one finding with OutcomeNegative (0).
  - If the project does not have a single workflow with possibility of script injection, the probe returns one finding with OutcomePositive (1).
remediation:
  effort: Low
