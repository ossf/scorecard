id: webhooksWithoutSecret
short: This check determines whether the webhooks defined in the repository have secrets configured to authenticate the origins of requests.
motivation: >
  Webhooks without secret authorization have the potential to make projects accessible to third-parties.
implementation: >
  The probe checks all webhooks of a project and checks whether each uses secret authentication.
outcome:
  - If the project has any webhooks without secret authorization, the probe returns as many OutcomeNegative (0) as the project has webhooks without secret authorization. All findings include the value "totalWebhooks" which is the total number of webhooks that the project has. The finding also includes the path to the webhook.
  - If the project does not have any webhooks without secret authorization, the probe returns one OutcomePositive (1).
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Check if the service your webhooks is configured with supports secrets.
    - If there is support for secret authentication, set the secret in the webhook configuration. See [Setting up a webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks#setting-up-a-webhook).
    - If there is no support for secret authentication, request the webhook service implement secret authentication functionality by following [these directions](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/securing-your-webhooks).
