id: hasPermissiveLicense
short: Check that the project has an permissive license.
motivation: >
  A permissive license allows users to use the analyzed component to be used in derivative works. Non-permissive licenses (as copyleft licenses) might be a legal risk for potential users.
implementation: >
 The implementation checks whether a permissive license is present
outcome:
  - If a license file is found and is permissive, the probe returns a single OutcomeTrue.
  - If a license file is missing the probe returns a single OutcomeFalse.
  - If the license is not permissive, the probe returns a single OutcomeFalse.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: High
  text:
    - A relicensing is necessary, or the component should not be used by the user for this purpose.
