id: toolPyUpInstalled
short: Check that PyUp is installed.
motivation: >
  Out-of-date dependencies make a project vulnerable to known flaws and prone to attacks.
  PyUp automates the process of updating dependencies by scanning for outdated or insecure requirements, and opening a pull request to update them if found.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for the presence of a file named ".pyup.yml".
  If the file is not found, PyUp is not installed.
  NOTE: the implementation does not ensure that PyUp is run or that PyUp's pull requests are merged.
outcome:
  - If PyUp is installed, the probe returns OutcomePositive (1) for each configuration.
  - If PyUp is not installed, the probe returns OutcomeNegative (0).
remediation:
  effort: Low
