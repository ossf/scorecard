id: webhooksUseSecrets
short: This check determines whether the webhooks defined in the repository have secrets configured to authenticate the origins of requests.
motivation: >
  Webhooks without secret authorization have the potential to make projects accessible to third-parties.
implementation: >
  The probe checks all webhooks of a project and checks whether each uses secret authentication.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomeTrue per webhook with secret authorization.
  - The probe returns one OutcomeFalse per webhook without secret authorization.
  - Projects without webhooks receive an OutcomeNotApplicable.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Check if the service your webhooks is configured with supports secrets.
    - If there is support for secret authentication, set the secret in the webhook configuration. See [Setting up a webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks#setting-up-a-webhook).
    - If there is no support for secret authentication, request the webhook service implement secret authentication functionality by following [these directions](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/securing-your-webhooks).
