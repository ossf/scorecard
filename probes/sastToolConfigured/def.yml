id: sastToolConfigured
short: Check that the project uses a SAST tool
motivation: >
  SAST is testing run on source code before the application is run. Using SAST tools can prevent known classes of bugs from being inadvertently introduced in the codebase.
implementation: >
  The implementation checks for evidence of various SAST tools. This includes configuration files, GitHub Action workflows, and GitHub PR check annotations.
outcome:
  - If the project uses a SAST tool we can detect, the probe returns one finding per tool with OutcomeTrue.
  - If the project does not use a SAST tool, or uses a tool we dont currently detect, the probe returns one finding with OutcomeFalse.
remediation:
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Setup one of tools we currently detect https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks/sast/README.md.
