motivation: >
  Allowing non-admins to delete project branches has a similar effect to performing force pushes.

outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomeTrue for each branch that is disallowed from users deleting it, and one OutcomeFalse for branches where users are able to delete it. Scorecard only considers default and releases branches.
