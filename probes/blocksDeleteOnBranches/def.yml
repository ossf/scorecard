id: blocksDeleteOnBranches
short: Check that the project blocks non-admins from deleting branches.
motivation: >
  Allowing non-admins to delete project branches has a similar effect to performing force pushes.
implementation: >
  Checks the protection rules of default and release branches.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each branch that is disallowed from users deleting it, and one OutcomeNegative for branches where users are able to delete it. Scorecard only considers default and releases branches.
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Disallow deletion of branches in your project to remove negative outcomes.
    - GitHub and GitLab by default disable deleting a protected branch.
