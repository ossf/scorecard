id: hasNoGitHubWorkflowPermissionUnknown
short: Checks that GitHub workflows have workflows with unknown permissions
motivation: >
  Unknown permissions may be a result of a bug or another error from fetching the permission levels.
implementation: >
  The probe checks the permission levels of a projects workflows and collects the workflows that have unknown permissions.
outcome:
  - The probe returns 1 false outcome per workflow without unknown permission level(s).
  - The probe returns 1 true outcome if the project has no workflows with unknown permission levels.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Low
