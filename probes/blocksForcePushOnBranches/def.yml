id: blocksForcePushOnBranches
short: Check that the project blocks force push on its branches.
motivation: >
  Allowing non-admins to force push to branches could allow untrusted users to make insecure changes to the behavior of the project.
implementation: >
  Checks the protection rules of default and release branches.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each branch that is blocked from force pushes, and one OutcomeNegative for branches that allows force push.
  - Returns OutcomeNotAvailable if Scorecard cannot fetch the data from the repository.
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Disallow force pushes branches in your project to remove negative outcomes.
    - For GitHub-hosted projects, force pushes are disabled by default. To make sure it has not been enabled, see ["Allow force pushes"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#allow-force-pushes).
    - For GitLab-hosted projects, follow the ["Protected branches"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html) documentation to see who can force push to the project.
