id: blocksForcePushOnBranches
short: Check that the project blocks force push on its branches.
motivation: >
  Allowing non-admins to force push to branches could allow untrusted users to make insecure changes to the behavior of the project.
implementation: >
  Checks the protection rules of each branch.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each branch that is blocked from force pushes, and one OutcomeNegative for branches that allows force push.
  - Returns OutcomeNotAvailable if Scorecard cannot fetch the data from the repository.
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
    - Disallow force pushes branches in your project to remove negative outcomes.
