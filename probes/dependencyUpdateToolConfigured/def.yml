id: dependencyUpdateToolConfigured
short: Check that a dependency update tool config is present.
motivation: >
  Out-of-date dependencies make a project vulnerable to known flaws and prone to attacks.
  Tools can automate the process of updating dependencies by scanning for outdated or insecure requirements, and opening a pull request to update them if found.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for the presence of various config files for different dependency update tools.
outcome:
  - If a dependency update tool is configured, the probe returns OutcomeTrue for each configuration.
  - If no tool is detected, the probe returns OutcomeFalse.
remediation:
  effort: Low
