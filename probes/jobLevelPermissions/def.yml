id: jobLevelPermissions
short: Checks that GitHub workflows do not have "write" permissions at the "job" level.
motivation: >
  In some circumstances, having "write" permissions at the "job" level may enable attackers to escalate privileges.
implementation: >
  The probe checks the permission level, the workflow type and the permission type of each workflow in the project.
outcome:
  - The probe returns 1 negative outcome per workflow with "write" permissions at the "job" level.
  - The probe returns 1 positive outcome if the project has no workflows "write" permissions a the "job" level.
remediation:
  effort: Low
