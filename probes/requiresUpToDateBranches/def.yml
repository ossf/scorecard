id: requiresUpToDateBranches
short: Check that the project requires PRs to be in sync with the base branch.
motivation: >
  Requiring PRs to be in sync with the base branch is good practice.
implementation: >
  The probe checks the branch protection rules of default and release branches in the repository.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomeTrue for each branch that requires PRs to be in sync with the base branch, and one OutcomeFalse for branches that don't.
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
    - Configure the repository such that it requires PRs to be in sync with the base branch.
    - For GitHub-hosted projects, followed [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging)
    - For GitLab-hosted projects, use [semi-linear merge methods](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/methods/#rebasing-in-semi-linear-merge-methods).
