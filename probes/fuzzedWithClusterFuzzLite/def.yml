id: fuzzedWithClusterFuzzLite
short: Check that the project is fuzzed using ClusterFuzzLite
motivation: >
  Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is the practice of feeding unexpected or random data into a program to expose bugs.
  Regular fuzzing is important to detect vulnerabilities that may be exploited by others, especially since attackers can also use fuzzing to find the same flaws.
implementation: >
 The implementation looks for a file called ".clusterfuzzlite/Dockerfile".
outcome:
  - If the file is found, one finding with OutcomePositive (1) is returned.
  - If the file is not found, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned.
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
    - Follow the steps in https://github.com/google/clusterfuzzlite to integrate fuzzing as part of CI.
    - Over time, try to add fuzzing for more functionalities of your project.
