short: Check that all recent changesets have been approved by someone who is not the author of the changeset.
motivation: >

  should have a minimum number of approvals.
implementation: >
  This probe looks for whether all changes over the last `--commit-depth` commits have been approved by a maintainer. Commits are grouped by the Pull Request they were introduced in, and each Pull Request must have at least one approval.
outcome:
  - If all commits were approved, the probe returns OutcomePositive (1)
  - If any commit was not approved, the prove returns OutcomeNegative (0)
