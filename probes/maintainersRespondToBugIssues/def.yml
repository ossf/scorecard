id: maintainersRespondToBugIssues
lifecycle: experimental
short: Checks if maintainers respond to issues labeled 'bug' or 'security' within 180 days
motivation: >
  Timely maintainer response to security and bug reports indicates active maintenance
  and commitment to addressing potential vulnerabilities and defects.
implementation: >
  Reads RawResults.MaintainerResponseResults containing issue label intervals and maintainer responses.
  For each issue that was ever labeled 'bug' or 'security', checks if a maintainer comment
  occurred within 180 days of the label being applied.
outcome:
  - If an issue received maintainer response within 180 days, one finding with OutcomeTrue is returned.
  - If an issue exceeded 180 days with 'bug' or 'security' label without maintainer response, one finding with OutcomeFalse is returned.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Low
