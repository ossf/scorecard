id: MTTUDependenciesIsHigh
lifecycle: experimental
short: Mean time since the oldest newer dependency release is high (≥ 6 months).
motivation: >
  Highly stale dependencies significantly increase security and operational risks. Long delays in updating
  dependencies make it more likely to miss critical security fixes and complicate incident response.
implementation: >
  The probe computes, for each declared dependency, the time elapsed since the oldest release newer than
  the version used by the project. Dependencies already on the latest version contribute zero. Pseudo-versions
  (unreleased development versions) are filtered out to ensure fair comparison. It then takes the mean
  across all dependencies. If the mean is ≥ 180 days (6 months), the probe returns OutcomeTrue;
  otherwise OutcomeFalse.
outcome:
  - OutcomeTrue when the mean time is ≥ 180 days (6 months).
  - OutcomeFalse when the mean time is < 180 days.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Reduce staleness by enabling automated updates and planning dependency upgrade sprints to bring the mean under 6 months.
    - Prioritize dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
    - Break down large update efforts into smaller, manageable chunks.
