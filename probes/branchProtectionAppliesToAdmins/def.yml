id: branchProtectionAppliesToAdmins
short: Check that the projects branch protection rules apply to project admins.
motivation: >
  Admins can make malicious code changes that users will be unaware of (see CVE-2022-23812); consuming software where this is disabled is encouraged.
implementation: >
  Checks the protection rules of default and release branches.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each branch that enforces branch protection rules on admins, and one OutcomeNegative for branches that don't.
remediation:
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - The remediation effort can be Low to High depending on other branch protection settings.
    - Enforce protection rules for admins on all branches.
    - For GitHub-hosted projects, see the ["Do not allow bypassing the above settings"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches#do-not-allow-bypassing-the-above-settings) section in the GitHub docs.
    - For Gitlab-hosted projects, see the ["Protected branches"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html) documentation.
