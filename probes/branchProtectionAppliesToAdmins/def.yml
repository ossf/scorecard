id: branchProtectionAppliesToAdmins
short: Check that the project's branch protection rules apply to project admins.
motivation: >
  Admins may be able to bypass branch protection settings which could defeat the purpose of having them.
implementation: >
  Checks the protection rules of default and release branches.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomeTrue for each branch that enforces branch protection rules on admins, and one OutcomeFalse for branches that don't.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - The remediation effort can be Low to High depending on other branch protection settings.
    - Enforce protection rules for admins on all branches.
