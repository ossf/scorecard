id: branchProtectionAppliesToAdmins
short: Check that the projects branch protection rules apply to project admins.
motivation: >
  Admins can make malicious code changes that users will be unaware of (see CVE-2022-23812); consuming software where this is disabled is encouraged.
implementation: >
  Checks the protection rules of each branch.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each branch that enforces branch protection rules on admins, and one OutcomeNegative for branches that don't.
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
    - Enforce protectoin rules for admins on all branches.
