id: privateVulnerabilityReportingEnabled
lifecycle: experimental
short: Check if private vulnerability reporting is enabled for the repository.
motivation: >
  Private vulnerability reporting allows security researchers to privately report
  vulnerabilities to maintainers, promoting responsible disclosure. This feature
  helps projects receive vulnerability reports without exposing sensitive details
  publicly before a fix is available.
implementation: >
  Checks if the repository has GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature enabled.
  This data is retrieved from the GitHub repository metadata.
outcome:
  - If private vulnerability reporting is enabled, one finding with OutcomeTrue is returned.
  - If private vulnerability reporting is not enabled, one finding with OutcomeFalse is returned.
  - If the check is not applicable (e.g., not a GitHub repository), one finding with OutcomeNotApplicable is returned.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Low
