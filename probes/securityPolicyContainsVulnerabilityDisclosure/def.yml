id: securityPolicyContainsVulnerabilityDisclosure
short: Check that the security policy indicates a vulnerability disclosure process.
motivation: >
  If someone finds a vulnerability in the project, it is important for them to be able to communicate it to the maintainers.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for strings "Disclos" and "Vuln".
outcome:
  - If information about the disclosure process is found in a security policy file, the probe returns one finding with OutcomePositive (1) for each file.
  - If no information about the disclosure process is found, the probe returns one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) for each file.
  - if no file is present, the probe returns one finding with OutcomeNegative (0).
remediation:
  effort: Low

    - 'On GitHub:'
    - Enable private vulnerability disclosure in your repository settings https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository
    - Add a section in your SECURITY.md indicating you have enabled private reporting, and tell them to follow the steps in https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability to report vulnerabilities.
    - 'On GitLab:'
    - Add a section in your SECURITY.md indicating the process to disclose vulnerabilities for your project.
    - 'Examples: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/SECURITY.md, https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/SECURITY.md, https://github.com/sigstore/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md.'
