short: Check that the javascript project is fuzzed using a property-based testing framework.
motivation: >
  Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is the practice of feeding unexpected or random data into a program to expose bugs.
  Regular fuzzing is important to detect vulnerabilities that may be exploited by others, especially since attackers can also use fuzzing to find the same flaws.
implementation: >
  The implementations looks for direct imports of fast-check https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check in .js files.
outcome:
  - If imports are found, each finding is returned with OutcomePositive (1).
  - If no import is detected, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned.
remediation:
  effort: High
