id: sastToolCodeQLInstalled
short: Check that the project uses the CodeQL github actions
motivation: >
  SAST is testing run on source code before the application is run. Using SAST tools can prevent known classes of bugs from being inadvertently introduced in the codebase.
implementation: >
  The implementation checks whether the project invokes the github/codeql-action/analyze workflow.
outcome:
  - If the project uses the github/codeql-action/analyze workflow, the probe returns one finding with OutcomePositive (1).
  - If the project does not use the github/codeql-action/analyze workflow, the probe returns one finding with OutcomeNegative (0).
remediation:
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Follow the steps in https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/preparing-your-code-for-codeql-analysis to integrate CodeQL for your project.
