id: MTTUDependenciesIsLow
lifecycle: experimental
short: Mean time since the oldest newer dependency release is moderate (3-6 months).
motivation: >
  Moderately stale dependencies increase operational and security risk over time. Keeping the mean time
  within a few months is better than large backlogs, but further improvement reduces exposure
  to vulnerabilities and incompatibilities.
implementation: >
  The probe computes, for each declared dependency, the time elapsed since the oldest release newer than
  the version used by the project. Dependencies already on the latest version contribute zero. Pseudo-versions
  (unreleased development versions) are filtered out to ensure fair comparison. It then takes the mean
  across all dependencies. If the mean is ≥ 90 days (3 months) and < 180 days (6 months), the probe returns
  OutcomeTrue; otherwise OutcomeFalse.
outcome:
  - OutcomeTrue when 90 days ≤ mean time < 180 days (3-6 months).
  - OutcomeFalse when mean time < 90 days or ≥ 180 days.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Schedule regular dependency updates (e.g., weekly or monthly) and use tools like Dependabot or Renovate to reduce backlog.
    - Prioritize security-related updates and plan upgrade sprints for major version updates.
