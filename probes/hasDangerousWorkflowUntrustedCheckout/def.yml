id: hasDangerousWorkflowUntrustedCheckout
short: Check whether the project has GitHub Actions workflows that does untrusted checkouts.
motivation: >
  GitHub workflows triggered with pull_request_target or workflow_run have write permission to the target repository and access to target repository secrets.
  Combined with a dangerous checkout of PR contents, attackers may be able to compromise the repository, for example, by using build scripts controlled by the PR author.
implementation: >
  The probe iterates through the workflows looking for pull_request_target and workflow_run triggers which checkout references from a PR.
  This check does not detect whether untrusted code checkouts are used safely, for example, only on pull request that have been assigned a label.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one finding with OutcomeTrue per untrusted checkout.
  - The probe returns one finding with OutcomeFalse if no untrusted checkouts are detected.
remediation:
  onOutcome: True
  effort: Low
