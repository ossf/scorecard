id: requiresPRsToChangeCode
short: Check that the project requires pull requests to change code.
motivation: >
  Changing code without pull requests does not leave a traceable trail and can allow malicious actors to sneak in vulnerable code.
implementation: >
  The probe checks which branches require pull requests to change the branches' code. The probe only considers default and release branches.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomeTrue for each branch that requires pull requests to change code, and one OutcomeFalse for branches that don't.
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
