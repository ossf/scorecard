id: releasesHaveProvenance
short: Check that the projects releases on GitHub and GitLab have provenance.
motivation: >
  Provenance give users security-critical, verifiable information so that consumers can verify their artifacts before consuming them.
implementation: >
  The probe checks whether any of the assets in any of the last five releases on GitHub or GitLab have a provenance file.
outcome:
  - For each of the last 5 releases, the probe returns OutcomeTrue, if the release has a provenance file in the release assets.
  - For each of the last 5 releases, the probe returns OutcomeFalse, if the release does not have a provenance file in the release assets.
  - If the project has no releases, the probe returns OutcomeNotApplicable.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Generate provenance and add it alongside the release assets. Use the [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) to add SLSA level 3 provenance to releases.
