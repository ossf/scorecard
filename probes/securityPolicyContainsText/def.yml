id: securityPolicyContainsText
short: Check that the security policy contains enough text.
motivation: >
  Telling security researchers how to privately dislose problems with your project is important. The more details available, the better.
implementation: >
  The implementation checks that the content of the SECURITY.md contains more than just a link or an email address. It does this by comparing the length of the content to the lengths of the links and email addresses.
outcome:
  - If links are found, one finding with OutcomePositive (1) is returned for each file.
  - If no links are found, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned for each file.
  - If no file is found, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned.
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Explain the process to disclose security vulnerability for your project.
    - 'On GitHub:'
    - Enable private vulnerability disclosure in your repository settings https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository
