id: testsRunInCI
short: Checks that the project runs tests in the CI for example with GitHub Actions or Prow.
motivation: >
  Running tests helps developers catch mistakes early on, which can reduce the number of vulnerabilities that find their way into a project.
implementation: >
 The probe checks for tests in the projects CI jobs in the recent commits (~30).
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each PR that ran CI tests and one OutcomeNegative for each PR that did not run CI tests.
  - The probe returns a single OutcomeNotApplicable if the projects has had no pull requests.
remediation:
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Check-in scripts that run all the tests in your repository.
    - Integrate those scripts with a CI/CD platform that runs it on every pull request (e.g. if hosted on GitHub, [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions), [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow), etc).
