short: Check that the project is fuzzed using OSS-Fuzz
motivation: >
  Packages give users of a project an easy way to download, install, update, and uninstall the software by a package manager. In particular, they make it easy for users to receive security patches as updates.
implementation: >
  The implementation checks whether a project uses common patterns for packaging across multiple ecosystems. Scorecard gets this by checking the projects workflows for specific uses of actions and build commands such as `docker push` or `mvn deploy`. 
outcome:
  - If the project has a package without a debug message, the outcome is positive.
  - If the project has a package with a debug message, the outcome is negative.
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Use a GitHub action to release your package to language-specific hubs.
