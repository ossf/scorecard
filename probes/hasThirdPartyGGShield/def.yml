short: GGShield runs in CI
motivation: >
  Detect whether the project runs GitGuardian GGShield in CI to catch leaked credentials.
  GGShield is a **commit-based scanner** typically configured to run on every push or pull request.
  The SecretScanning check scores this probe based on commit coverage:
  100% coverage=10 points, 70-99%=7, 50-69%=5, <50%=3, tool present but not running=1.
implementation: >
  Reads RawResults.SecretScanningResults.ThirdPartyGGShield from parsed CI configs.
  Analyzes the last 100 commits via ListCommits() and ListCheckRunsForRef() to
  calculate what percentage of commits had GGShield run in CI.
outcome:
  - The probe emits OutcomeTrue if GitGuardian GGShield is configured in CI, and OutcomeFalse otherwise.
  - Score depends on commit coverage, not just tool presence.
ecosystem:
  languages: [all]
  clients: [github, gitlab]
