id: hasBinaryArtifacts
short: Checks if the project has any binary files in its source tree.
motivation: >
  Binary files are not human readable so users and reviewers can't easily see what they do.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for the presence of binary files. This is a more restrictive probe than "hasUnverifiedBinaryArtifacts" which excludes verified binary files.
outcome:
  - If the probe finds binary files, it returns one OutcomeTrue for each binary file found.
  - If the probe finds no binary files, it returns a single OutcomeFalse.
remediation:
  onOutcome: True
  effort: Medium
