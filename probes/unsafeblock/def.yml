id: unsafeblock
lifecycle: experimental
short: Flags unsafe blocks of code in this project.
motivation: >
  Memory safety in software should be considered a continuum, rather than being binary. 
  While some languages and tools are memory safe by default, it may still be possible, and sometimes unavoidable, to write unsafe code in them.
  Unsafe code allow developers to bypass normal safety checks and directly manipulate memory.
implementation: >
  The probe is ecosystem-specific and will surface non memory safe practices in the project by identifying unsafe code blocks.
  Unsafe code blocks are supported in rust, go, c#, and swift, but only go and c# are supported by this probe at this time:
  - for go the probe will look for the use of the `unsafe` include directive.
  - for c# the probe will look at the csproj and identify the use of the `AllowUnsafeBlocks` property.
outcome:
  - For supported ecosystem, the probe returns OutcomeFalse per unsafe block.
  - If the project has no unsafe blocks, the probe returns OutcomeTrue.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Medium
