id: hasThirdPartyRepoSupervisor
lifecycle: beta
short: repo-supervisor runs in CI
motivation: >
  Detect whether the project runs repo-supervisor to catch leaked credentials.
  repo-supervisor is a **periodic scanner** typically configured to run on a schedule (e.g., daily/weekly).
  The SecretScanning check scores this probe as: 10 points if ran in last 30 days, 1 point otherwise.
implementation: >
  Reads RawResults.SecretScanningResults.ThirdPartyRepoSupervisor from parsed CI configs.
  Checks CI run history via ListCommits() and ListCheckRunsForRef() to determine if
  repo-supervisor ran within the last 30 days.
outcome:
  - The probe emits OutcomeTrue if repo-supervisor is configured, and OutcomeFalse otherwise.
  - Score is 10 if ran recently (last 30 days), otherwise 1.
ecosystem:
  languages: [all]
  clients: [github, gitlab]
