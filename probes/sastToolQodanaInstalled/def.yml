  SAST is testing run on source code before the application is run. Using SAST tools can prevent known classes of bugs from being inadvertently introduced in the codebase.
implementation: >
  The implementation checks whether the project invokes the JetBrains/qodana-action action.
outcome:
  - If the project uses the JetBrains/qodana-action action, the probe returns one finding with OutcomePositive (1).
  - If the project does not use the JetBrains/qodana-action action, the probe returns one finding with OutcomeNegative (0).
