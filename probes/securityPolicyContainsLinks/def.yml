id: securityPolicyContainsLinks
short: Check that the security policy contains web or email links.
motivation: >
  URLs point users to additional information as well as online disclosure forms. Emails provide a point of contact for vulnerability disclosure.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for strings "http(s)://" to find URLs; and for strings "...@..." for email addresses.
outcome:
  - If links are found, one finding with OutcomePositive (1) is returned for each file.
  - If no links are found, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned for each file.
  - If no file is found, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned.
remediation:
  effort: Low

    - 'On GitHub:'
    - Enable private vulnerability disclosure in your repository settings https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository
    - Add a section in your SECURITY.md indicating you have enabled private reporting, and tell them to follow the steps in https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability to report vulnerabilities.
    - 'On GitLab:'
    - Provide a point of contact in your SECURITY.md.
