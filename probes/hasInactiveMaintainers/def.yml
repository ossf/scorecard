id: hasInactiveMaintainers
lifecycle: experimental
short: Check whether the project has inactive maintainers.
motivation: >
  Projects that have inactive maintainers may be more difficult to get timely
  security fixes and updates. Maintainers with elevated access who have not
  participated in the project within a reasonable time frame (6 months) may
  present a security risk if their accounts become compromised.
implementation: >
  The probe identifies users with elevated repository permissions (TRIAGE, WRITE,
  MAINTAIN, or ADMIN access) and checks if they have shown activity in the last 6
  months. Activity includes various maintenance-related contributions:
  - **Primary signals**: commits, merged pull requests, releases
  - **Code review**: PR reviews, issue/PR comments, commit comments
  - **Issue/PR management**: creating, closing, or assigning issues/PRs; adding reactions
  - **Triage**: label management, milestone creation/assignment
  - **Project management**: GitHub Discussions, Project boards, repository settings
  - **Security**: security advisories, Dependabot alert dismissals
  - **Workflows**: GitHub Actions workflow runs
  
  The probe returns one finding per maintainer indicating whether they have been
  active or inactive.
outcome:
  - If a maintainer has shown activity in the last 6 months, one OutcomeFalse finding is returned
  - If a maintainer has shown no activity in the last 6 months, one OutcomeTrue finding is returned
remediation:
  onOutcome: True
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Review the list of maintainers with elevated access to your repository.
    - Remove or downgrade access for maintainers who are no longer actively participating.
    - Consider implementing a policy for regular review of maintainer access rights.
    - Encourage inactive maintainers to remain engaged or formally step down from their role.
