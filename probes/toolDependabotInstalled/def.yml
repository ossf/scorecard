id: toolDependabotInstalled
short: Check that Dependabot is enabled
motivation: >
  Out-of-date dependencies make a project vulnerable to known flaws and prone to attacks.
  Dependabot automates the process of updating dependencies by scanning for outdated or insecure requirements, and opening a pull request to update them if found.
implementation: >
  The implemtation looks for the presence of files named ".github/dependabot.yml" or ".github/dependabot.yaml". If none of these files are found,
  the implementation checks whether commits are authored by Dependabot. If none of these succeed, Dependabot is not installed.
  NOTE: if the configuration files are found, the probe does not ensure that the Dependabot is run or that the Dependabot's pull requests are merged.
outcome:
  - If dependendabot is installed, the probe returns OutcomePositive (1)
  - If dependendabot is not installed, the probe returns OutcomeNegative (0)
remediation:
  effort: Low
