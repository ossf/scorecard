id: hasUnverifiedBinaryArtifacts
short: Checks if the project has binary files in its source tree. The probe skips verified binary files which currently are gradle-wrappers.
motivation: >
  Binary files are not readable so users can't see what they do. Many programming language systems can generate executables from source code (e.g., C/C++ generated machine code, Java .class files, Python .pyc files, and minified JavaScript). Users will often directly use executables if they are included in the source repository, leading to many dangerous behaviors.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for the presence of binary files that are not "verified". A verified binary is one that Scorecard considers valid for building and/or releasing the project. This is a more permissive probe than "hasBinaryArtifacts" which does not skip verified binary files.
outcome:
  - If the probe finds unverified binary files, it returns a number of true outcomes equal to the number of unverified binary files found. Each outcome includes a location of the file.
  - If the probe finds no unverified binary files, it returns a single false outcome.
remediation:
  onOutcome: True
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Remove the generated executable artifacts from the repository.
    - Build from source.
