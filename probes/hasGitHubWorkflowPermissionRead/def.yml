id: hasGitHubWorkflowPermissionRead
short: Checks that the project has any Workflows with permission level "read".
motivation: >
  Setting permission levels to none is positive if the project does not need write permisions for the given workflow.
  It prevents write actions against the given resource type.
implementation: >
  The probe checks for workflows with "read" set as the permission level.
outcome:
  - The probe returns 1 positive outcome per workflow with "read" set as its permission level.
  - The probe returns 1 OutcomeNotApplicable if no workflows have permission level set to "read"
remediation:
  effort: Low
