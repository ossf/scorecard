id: requiresApproversForPullRequests
short: Check that the project requires approvers for pull requests.
motivation: >
  Requiring approvers for pull requests makes it harder to introduce vulnerable code to the project.
implementation: >
  The probe checks the number of required approvers in default and release branches of the project.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each branch that requires approval for PRs, and one OutcomeNegative for branches that don't.
remediation:
  effort: High
