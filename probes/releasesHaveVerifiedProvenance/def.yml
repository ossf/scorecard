id: releasesHaveVerifiedProvenance
short: Checks if the project releases with provenance attestations
motivation: >
  Package provenance attestations provide a greater guarantee of authenticity and integrity than package signatures alone, since the attestation can be performed over a hash of both the package contents and metadata. Developers can attest to particular qualities of the build, such as the build environment, build steps or builder identity.
implementation: >
  This probe checks how many packages published by the repository are associated with verified SLSA provenance attestations. It uses data from a ProjectPackageClient, which associates a GitHub/GitLab project with a package in a package manager. Using the data from the package manager (whom we rely on to verify the provenance attestation), this probe returns a finding for each release. For now, only NPM is supported.
outcome:
  - For each release, the probe returns OutcomeTrue or OutcomeFalse, depending on if the package has a verified provenance attestation.
  - If we didn't find a package or didn't find releases, return OutcomeNotAvailable.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Low
  text:
  - For NPM, publish provenance alongside your package using the `--provenance` flag (See (Introducing npm package provenance)[https://github.blog/2023-04-19-introducing-npm-package-provenance/])
