id: hasDangerousWorkflowTrigger
short: Check whether the project has privileged GitHub Actions workflows that can be triggered on workflow_run
motivation: >
  Using the workflow_run trigger for a privileged workflow may allow an attacker to open a pull request that executes the
  triggering workflow, even if the target workflow is not intended to be run on pull requests
implementation: >
  The probe looks for any workflows that combine the workflow_run trigger with usage of the GITHUB_TOKEN secret. This
  is an indirect indicator that the workflow is doing something important, like pushing code, uploading artifacts, or
  tagging builds. 
outcome:
  - If the project has at least one dangerous workflow using the on_worfklow trigger, the probe returns one finding with OutcomeNegative (0).
  - If the project does not have any dangerous workflows using the on_worfklow trigger, the probe returns one finding with OutcomePositive (1).
remediation:
  effort: Low
  text:
    - Combine both the source and target of the on_workflow trigger into a single workflow. 
  markdown:
    - Combine both the source and target of the `on_workflow` trigger into a single workflow.
