id: issueActivityByProjectMember
short: Checks that a collaborator, member or owner has participated in issues in the last 90 days.
motivation: >
  A project which is not active might not be patched, have its dependencies patched, or be actively tested and used. However, a lack of active maintenance is not necessarily always a problem. Some software, especially smaller utility functions, does not normally need to be maintained. For example, a library that determines if an integer is even would not normally need maintenance unless an underlying implementation language definition changed. A lack of active maintenance should signal that potential users should investigate further to judge the situation.
implementation: >
  The probe checks whether collaborators, members or owners of a project have participated in issues in the last 90 days.
outcome:
  - If collaborators, members or owners have participated in issues in the last 90 days, the probe returns one OutcomeTrue. The probe also returns a "numberOfIssuesUpdatedWithinThreshold" value with represents the number of issues on the repository which project collaborators, members or owners have shown activity in.
  - If collaborators, members or owners have NOT participated in issues in the last 90 days, the probe returns a single OutcomeFalse.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: High
