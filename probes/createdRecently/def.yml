id: createdRecently
short: Checks if the project was created in the last 90 days.
motivation: >
  Recently created repositories have been used for malicious forks / typosquatting attacks in the past.
  A newly created repo is not a strong signal on its own, but can be a useful piece of information.  
implementation: >
  The implementation checks the creation date is within the last 90 days.
outcome:
  - If the project was created within the last 90 days, the outcome is OutcomeTrue.
  - If the project is older than 90 days, the outcome is OutcomeFalse. The finding will include a "lookBackDays" value which is the time period that the probe looks back in. 
remediation:
  onOutcome: True
  effort: Low
  text:
    - The only remediation for this probe is to wait until 90 days have passed after a project has been created.
ecosystem:
  languages:
    - all
