id: releasesAreSigned
short: Check that the projects GitHub and GitLab releases are signed.
motivation: >
  Signed releases allow consumers to verify their artifacts before consuming them.
implementation: >
  The implementation checks whether a signature file is present in release assets. The probe checks the last 5 releases on GitHub and GitLab.
outcome:
  - For each of the last 5 releases, the probe returns OutcomePositive, if the release has a signature file in the release assets.
  - For each of the last 5 releases, the probe returns OutcomeNegative, if the release does not have a signature file in the release assets.
  - If the project has no releases, the probe returns OutcomeNotApplicable.
remediation:
  effort: Medium
