id: hasReleaseSBOM
lifecycle: experimental
short: Check that the project publishes an SBOM as part of its release artifacts.
motivation: >
  An SBOM can give users information about how the source code components and dependencies. They help facilitate sotware supplychain security and aid in identifying upstream vulnerabilities in a codebase.
implementation: >
  The implementation checks whether a SBOM artifact is included in release artifacts.
outcome:
  - If SBOM artifacts are found, the probe returns OutcomeTrue for each SBOM artifact up to 5.
  - If an SBOM artifact is not found, the probe returns a single OutcomeFalse.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Low

    - For Github projects, start with [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-supply-chain-security) to determine which steps are needed to generate an adequate SBOM.
    - For Gitlab projects, see existing [Dependency Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.html#cyclonedx-software-bill-of-materials) and [Container Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/container_scanning/index.html#cyclonedx-software-bill-of-materials) tools. 
    - Alternatively, there are other tools available to generate [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/) and [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/use/tools/) SBOMs.
