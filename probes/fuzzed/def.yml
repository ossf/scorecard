id: fuzzed
lifecycle: stable
short: Check that the project is fuzzed
motivation: >
  Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is the practice of feeding unexpected or random data into a program to expose bugs.
  Regular fuzzing is important to detect vulnerabilities that may be exploited by others, especially since attackers can also use fuzzing to find the same flaws.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for various fuzzing function signatures, imports, configuration files, and external integration data.
outcome:
  - If a fuzzing tool is found, one finding per tool with OutcomeTrue is returned.
  - If no fuzzing tool is found, or the project uses a tool we don't detect, one finding with OutcomeFalse is returned.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: High
