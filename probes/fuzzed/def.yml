id: fuzzed
short: Check that the project is fuzzed
motivation: >
  Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is the practice of feeding unexpected or random data into a program to expose bugs.
  Regular fuzzing is important to detect vulnerabilities that may be exploited by others, especially since attackers can also use fuzzing to find the same flaws.
implementation: >
  TODO
outcome:
  - If a fuzzing tool is found, one finding per tool with OutcomePositive is returned.
  - If no fuzzing tool is found, or the project uses a tool we don't detect, one finding with OutcomeNegative is returned.
