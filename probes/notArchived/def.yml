id: notArchived
short: Check that the project is archived
motivation: >
  A project which is not active might not be patched, have its dependencies patched, or be actively tested and used. However, a lack of active maintenance is not necessarily always a problem. Some software, especially smaller utility functions, does not normally need to be maintained. For example, a library that determines if an integer is even would not normally need maintenance unless an underlying implementation language definition changed. A lack of active maintenance should signal that potential users should investigate further to judge the situation.
implementation: >
  The probe checks the Archived Status of a project.
