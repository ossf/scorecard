id: fuzzedWithGoNative
short: Check that the project is fuzzed using Go native fuzzing framework
motivation: >
  Fuzzing, or fuzz testing, is the practice of feeding unexpected or random data into a program to expose bugs.
  Regular fuzzing is important to detect vulnerabilities that may be exploited by others, especially since attackers can also use fuzzing to find the same flaws.
implementation: >
 The implementation checks whether fo the presence of functions with the signature 'func FuzzSomeName(*testing.F)' in .go files.
outcome:
  - If fuzzing functions are found, each finding is returned with OutcomePositive (1).
  - If no fuzzing is detected, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0) is returned.
remediation:
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Follow the steps in https://go.dev/doc/fuzz/ to enable fuzzing on your project.
    - Over time, try to add fuzzing for more functionalities of your project.
