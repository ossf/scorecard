id: securityPolicyPresentInRepo
short: Check if a security policy is defined in the repository.
motivation: >
  A security policy (typically a SECURITY.md file) can give users information about what constitutes a vulnerability and how to report one securely so that information about a bug is not publicly visible.
  If you have a large orgnization, having a unified security policy across all your repositories may simplify the vulnerability disclosure response.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for the presence of security policy files in the repository. See https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/raw/security_policy.go#L139 for a detailed list of filenames.
outcome:
  - If at least one security policy file is found, one finding with OutcomePositive (1) is returned.
  - If no security files are found, one finding with OutcomeNegative (0).
remediation:
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - 'On GitHub:'
    - Enable private vulnerability disclosure in your repository settings https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository
    - Add a section in your SECURITY.md indicating you have enabled private reporting, and tell them to follow the steps in https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability to report vulnerabilities.
    - 'On GitLab:'
    - Add a section in your SECURITY.md indicating the process to disclose vulnerabilities for your project.
    - 'Examples: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/SECURITY.md, https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/SECURITY.md, https://github.com/sigstore/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md.'
    - For additional information on vulnerability disclosure, see https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md.
  markdown:
    - Write a short paragraph for your SECURITY.md to explain the process to disclose security vulnerability for your project.
    - 'On GitHub:'
    - Enable private vulnerability disclosure in your [repository settings](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository)
    - Add a section in your SECURITY.md indicating you have enabled private reporting, and tell them to [follow these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability to report vulnerabilities).
    - 'On GitLab:'
    - Provide a point of contact in your SECURITY.md.
    - 'Examples: [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/SECURITY.md), [SLSA builders](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/blob/main/SECURITY.md), [Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).'
