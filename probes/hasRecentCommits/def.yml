id: hasRecentCommits
short: Check whether the project has at least one commit per week over the last 90 days.
motivation: >
  A project which is not active might not be patched, have its dependencies patched, or be actively tested and used.
  A lack of active maintenance should signal that potential users should investigate further to judge the situation.
  A project may not need further features or maintenance; In this case, the probe results can be disregarded.
implementation: >
  The implementation checks the number of commits made in the last 90 days by any user type.
outcome:
  - If the project has commits from the last 90 days, the probe returns one OutcomeTrue with a "commitsWithinThreshold" value which contains the number of commits that the probe found within the threshold. The probe will also return a "lookBackDays" value which is the number of days that the probe includes in its threshold - which is 90.
  - If the project does not have commits in the last 90 days, the probe returns a single OutcomeFalse.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Low
  text:
    - The only way to remediate this probe is to make contributions to the project, however, some projects have reached a level of maturity that does require further contributions.
