id: topLevelPermissions
short: Checks that the project does not have any top-level write permissions in its workflows.
motivation: >
  In some circumstances, having "write" permissions at the "top" level may enable attackers to escalate privileges.
implementation: >
  The probe checks the permission level, the workflow type and the permission type of each workflow in the project.
outcome:
  - The probe returns 1 negative outcome per workflow with "write" permissions at the "top" level.
  - The probe returns 1 true outcome if the project has no workflows "write" permissions a the "top" level.
remediation:
  effort: Low
