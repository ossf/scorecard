id: MTTUDependenciesIsVeryLow
lifecycle: experimental
short: Mean time since the oldest newer dependency release is very low (< 3 months).
motivation: >
  Keeping dependencies fresh reduces exposure to known vulnerabilities and supply-chain risk, and
  makes it easier to adopt security fixes quickly. A very low mean time indicates that the project
  updates promptly when newer releases are available.
implementation: >
  The probe computes, for each declared dependency, the time elapsed since the oldest release newer than
  the version used by the project. Dependencies already on the latest version contribute zero. Pseudo-versions
  (unreleased development versions) are filtered out to ensure fair comparison. It then takes the mean
  across all dependencies. If the mean is less than 90 days (3 months), the probe returns OutcomeTrue;
  otherwise OutcomeFalse.
outcome:
  - OutcomeTrue when the mean time is < 90 days (3 months).
  - OutcomeFalse when the mean time is >= 90 days.
remediation:
  onOutcome: False
  effort: Medium
  text:
    - Enable automated dependency update tools (e.g., Dependabot, Renovate) and triage PRs promptly.
    - Establish a regular dependency review cadence (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly).
