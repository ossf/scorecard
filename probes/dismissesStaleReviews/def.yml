id: dismissesStaleReviews
short: Check that the project dismisses stale reviews when new commits are pushed.
motivation: >
  When a project does not dismiss stale reviews, contributors can bring their pull requests to an approved state and then make malicious commits.
implementation: >
  Checks the protection rules of default and release branches.
outcome:
  - The probe returns one OutcomePositive for each branch that dismisses the stale status of PRs, and one OutcomeNegative for branches that don't.
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
