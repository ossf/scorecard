    - Determine which license to apply to your project. For GitHub hosted projects, follow those instructions to establish a license for your project.
    - For other hosting environments, create the license in a .adoc, .asc, .docx, .doc, .ext, .html, .markdown, .md, .rst, .txt, or .xml, named LICENSE, COPYRIGHT, or COPYING, and place it in the top-level directory. To identify a specific license, use an SPDX license identifier in the filename. Examples include LICENSE.md, Apache-2.0-LICENSE.md or LICENSE-Apache-2.0.
    - Alternately, create a LICENSE directory and add a license file(s) with a name that matches your SPDX license identifier. such as LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt.
