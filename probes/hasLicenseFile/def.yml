short: Check that the project has a license file
motivation: >
  A license can give users information about how the source code may or may not be used. The lack of a license will impede any kind of security review or audit and creates a legal risk for potential users.

 The implementation checks whether a license file is present.
outcome:
  - If license files are found, the probe returns OutcomePositive for each license file.
  - If a license file is not found, the probe returns a single OutcomeNegative.

    - For Github projects, follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) to determine which license to apply to your project and establish a license file for your project.
    - For Gitlab projects, create the license in a .adoc, .asc, .docx, .doc, .ext, .html, .markdown, .md, .rst, .txt, or .xml, named LICENSE, COPYRIGHT, or COPYING, and place it in the top-level directory. To identify a specific license, use an SPDX license identifier in the filename. Examples include LICENSE.md, Apache-2.0-LICENSE.md or LICENSE-Apache-2.0.
    - Alternately, create a LICENSE directory and add a license file(s) with a name that matches your SPDX license identifier. such as LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt.
