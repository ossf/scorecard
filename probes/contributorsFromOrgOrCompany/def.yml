id: contributorsFromOrgOrCompany
short: Checks whether a project has a contributions from users associated with a company or organization.
motivation: >
  This probe tries to determine if the project has recent contributors from multiple organizations (e.g., companies). 

  Some projects cannot meet this requirement, such as small projects with only one active participant, or projects with a narrow scope that cannot attract the interest of multiple organizations. See Code Reviews for more information about evaluating projects with a small number of participants.
  
implementation: >
  The probe looks at the Company field on the user profile for authors of recent commits. To receive the highest score, the project must have had contributors from at least 3 different companies in the last 30 commits.
outcome:
  - If the project has no contributing organizations or companies, the probe returns 1 OutcomeNegative
  - If the project has contributing organizations or companies, the probe returns 1 Outcome per org or company.
  - If the probe fails to process the raw results, it returns nil instead of the findings slice as well as an error.
remediation:
  effort: High
  text:
    - Encourage community-driven contributions to your project.
    - Ask contributors to join their respective organizations, if they have not already. Otherwise, there is no remediation for this probe; it simply provides insight into how many organizations have contributed so that you can make a trust-based decision based on that information.
