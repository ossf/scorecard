id: toolSonatypeLiftInstalled
short: Check that Sonatype Lyft is installed.
motivation: >
  Out-of-date dependencies make a project vulnerable to known flaws and prone to attacks.
  Sonatype Lyft automates the process of updating dependencies by scanning for outdated or insecure requirements, and opening a pull request to update them if found.
implementation: >
  The implementation looks for the presence of files named ".lift.toml" or ".lift/config.toml".
  If none of these files are found, Sonatype Lyft is not installed.
  NOTE: the implementation does not ensure that Sonatype Lyft is run or that Sonatype Lyft's pull requests are merged.
outcome:
  - If Sonatype Lyft is installed, the probe returns OutcomePositive (1) for each configuration.
  - If Sonatype Lyft is not installed, the probe returns OutcomeNegative (0).
remediation:
  effort: Low
